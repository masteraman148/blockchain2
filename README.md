# NFT Diplomas DApp on Aptos

## Project Vision
The **NFT Diplomas DApp** is a decentralized platform for issuing, verifying, and managing diplomas as **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** on the **Aptos blockchain**. Universities and institutions can issue NFT diplomas to graduates, providing them with tamper-proof, verifiable digital credentials. The **React** frontend enables users to view their diplomas, while the **Petra wallet** allows for secure authentication and transaction signing.

## Features
- **Decentralized Diploma Issuance**: Diplomas are minted as NFTs on the blockchain.
- **Verifiable Digital Credentials**: Each diploma can be verified as authentic and unique.
- **React Frontend**: Modern, responsive interface for managing diplomas.
- **Aptos Move Smart Contracts**: Secure diploma issuance using the Aptos Move language.
- **Petra Wallet Integration**: Petra wallet enables user authentication and transaction signing.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Blockchain**: Aptos (Move Language)
- **Wallet**: Petra Wallet

## How It Works
1. **Issue a Diploma**: Institutions can mint diplomas as NFTs for graduates.
2. **Store on Blockchain**: The diploma is stored immutably on the Aptos blockchain.
3. **Verify Diplomas**: Diplomas can be verified for authenticity by checking the NFT on the blockchain.
4. **Petra Wallet**: Use Petra Wallet to sign and confirm blockchain transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Aptos CLI](https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/)
- [Petra Wallet](https://petra.app/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aptos-nft-diplomas.git
   cd aptos-nft-diplomas
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the Aptos environment:
   - Install Aptos CLI:  
     ```bash
     curl -sSf https://aptos.dev/cli-tools/install | sh
     ```
   - Create an Aptos account:
     ```bash
     aptos init
     ```
   - Fund the account using the Aptos faucet (Devnet):
     ```bash
     aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_account_address
     ```

4. Deploy the Move smart contract:
   - Navigate to the `move` folder in your project.
   - Build and deploy the contract:
     ```bash
     aptos move compile
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     ```

5. Run the React frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Ensure **Petra Wallet** is installed and connected to interact with the DApp.

### Deployment

1. **Deploy on Aptos Devnet/Testnet**:
   - **Build the Move contract**:
     ```bash
     aptos move compile
     ```
   - **Deploy the contract**:
     ```bash
     aptos move publish --profile devnet
     ```
   - The contract will be deployed on Aptos Devnet/Testnet. Make sure to copy the contract address for frontend integration.
   
2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy the React app using any preferred service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   - Update the contract address and Aptos network configurations in the frontend code.

### Usage
- Go to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` or deployed link).
- Connect your **Petra Wallet**.
- Universities can issue diplomas as NFTs, and graduates can view and verify their diplomas on the blockchain.

## Aptos CLI Commands
- **Check account balance**:
  ```bash
  aptos account balance --profile devnet
  ```
- **Deploy Move contract**:
  ```bash
  aptos move publish --profile devnet
  ```
- **Fund account with Devnet faucet**:
  ```bash
  aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_account_address
  ```

## Future Scope
The NFT Diplomas DApp can be expanded and enhanced in the following ways:
1. **Multi-Institution Support**: Expand the platform to allow multiple universities and institutions to issue diplomas.
2. **Diploma Verification API**: Provide a public API for third parties (e.g., employers) to verify the authenticity of diplomas.
3. **Mobile App Integration**: Build a mobile version of the DApp to allow easy access and verification.
4. **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Expand the DApp to support NFT diplomas on other blockchain networks.
5. **Alumni Networking**: Introduce a platform where alumni can network using verified NFT diplomas.
6. **Student Achievement NFTs**: Extend the DApp to issue NFTs for other achievements, such as awards, certifications, and coursework.
7. **Enhanced Security**: Implement features like multi-signature transactions for issuing diplomas or deleting NFTs for increased security.
